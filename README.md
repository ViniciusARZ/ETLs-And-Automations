# GoogleDrive_SalesData_ETLs

This Repository has Extract, transform, load (ETLs) processes that I made to get data from Google Drive Workspace, because it's what I use at my work, clean it up and then load as a secondary file.
The purpose is easy the way to load Dashboards and Reports in Power BI and Google Data Studio.
